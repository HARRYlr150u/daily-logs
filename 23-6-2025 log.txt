today, I did nothing but tried a lot to reset my pc but it didn't worked at all i got some issues after which i exhausted a lot, well apart from that 
     ➰I continued with my physics revision ✅
     ➰I continued with my maths practice ✅
     as usual i was not able to work on my website because i was bounded back with the neverending problem of not able to resetting my laptop.

     well today i went outside as always for some fresh air. The day really very amazing until i talk about that resetting stuff and all, And also I talked to pragati and I came to know 
     that she suffering from her periods and I just helped her to calm her down but any how I felt like unimportant in her life again as usual but still I care for her even if she is not my 
     girlfriend.

     well this was it about my day. see you next time.
