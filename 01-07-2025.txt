HEY, HARSH THIS SIDE..
      TODAY THE FIRST DAY OF JULY--
   ---I HAVE BEEN WORKING UPON THE THEORY OF IC ENGINES AND I HAVE COMPLETED THE BASICS LIKE THE MACHINE PARTS WHICH ARE BEING USED INTO THE ENGINE.
   -----AND I HAVE ALSO BEEN REVISING MY MATHS SKILLS AND SOME NEWLY LEARNED SOLVING SKILLS
------IN THE CASE OF PHYSICS I AM TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE WHOLE CHAPTER WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE TOPIC -"THERMODYNAMICS"


                 FUTURE PLANN---
                                1. COMPLETING THE THEORY OF IC ENGINE AS IF I GOTTA TRY IT AS AN EXPERIMENT
                                2. COMPLETEING MATHS UNTOUCHED THEORY BY ME. SINCE I AM QUITE BAD AT MATHS AND I AM TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER THAN IT SEEMS TO ME.
                                3. COMPLETE THE WHOLE PHYSICS REVISION NEEDED IN MECHACNIAL ENGINEERING ..


                    THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY IN CASE OF SELFDEVELOPMENT AND SELFIMPROVEMENT
 IN CASE OF THE HAPPY LIFE SESSION--
          - I HAVE TO SPEND TIME WITH MY FREINDS OUTSIDE AND I GOTTA LAUGH A LOT BECAUSE I FEEL VERY EXHAUSTED WHEN I AM ALONE IN MY ROOM ALTHOUGH I HAVE MUCH TO DO BUT STILL
            I FEEL LIKE DOING NOTHING AT ALL. 
     SO YEAH THIS WAS MY DAY -- PLANNED, EXECUTED , IMPROVED---
