THIS IS A THEORY OF AN IC-ENGINE (INTERNAL CONBUSTION ENGINE)
 ----------- THE WORKING PRINCIPLE OF AN IC-ENGINE---------------
_>>_  WORKING PRINCIPLE OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION (IC) ENGINE:

AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WORKS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CONVERTING CHEMICAL ENERGY OF FUEL INTO MECHANICAL ENERGY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF COMBUSTION TAKING PLACE INSIDE THE ENGINE CYLINDER.

THE BASIC WORKING CYCLE OF AN IC ENGINE (LIKE A FOUR-STROKE ENGINE) INCLUDES FOUR MAIN STROKES:

1.SUCTION (INTAKE) STROKE:
THE INTAKE VALVE OPENS, AND THE PISTON MOVES DOWNWARD, ALLOWING THE AIR-FUEL MIXTURE (IN PETROL ENGINES) OR AIR (IN DIESEL ENGINES) TO ENTER THE CYLINDER.

2.COMPRESSION STROKE:
THE INTAKE VALVE CLOSES, AND THE PISTON MOVES UPWARD, COMPRESSING THE MIXTURE TO A HIGH PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE.

3.POWER (COMBUSTION) STROKE:
IN PETROL ENGINES, A SPARK PLUG IGNITES THE COMPRESSED MIXTURE. IN DIESEL ENGINES, FUEL IS INJECTED INTO THE COMPRESSED HOT AIR, CAUSING COMBUSTION.
THIS RAPID COMBUSTION PUSHES THE PISTON DOWNWARD, GENERATING MECHANICAL POWER.

4.EXHAUST STROKE:
THE EXHAUST VALVE OPENS, AND THE PISTON MOVES UPWARD AGAIN, FORCING THE BURNT GASES OUT OF THE CYLINDER.

THIS CYCLE REPEATS CONTINUOUSLY, CONVERTING FUEL ENERGY INTO MECHANICAL WORK TO POWER VEHICLES AND MACHINERY.
THE RECIPROCATING MOTION OF THE PISTON IS CONVERTED INTO ROTATIONAL MOTION BY THE CRANKSHAFT.
